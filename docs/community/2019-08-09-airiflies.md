description: Airi Flies is an interactive game played using your voice. To start the game say PLAY. Say PEW to make Airi fly. If you lose more than 8 points or hit an obstacle, you lose. This project was created to encourage people to get out of their comfort zone and feel more confident about themselves regardless of what they do and what they look or sound like.
