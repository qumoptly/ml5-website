title: Touch Type
author: Richard Yee
description: An interactive type projection/website that mashes the simple body tracking provided by Posenet with particle movement based on the Reynolds Flocking algorithm. When there is no one in view, the installation renders an ambient flow of boids. But when PoseNet detects a person in view, the particles become letterforms that can be distorted with your hands.
